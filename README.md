<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## :desktop_computer: About The Project

[![website-screenshot]](https://eldoraboo.github.io/PairALegal/)

Navigating the legal system for the ordinary layperson is confusing, and our project seeks to algorithmically find lawyers who can best suit their individual needs. Our team proposes a solution named Pair-A-Legal – a chatbot paired with a website depository filled with succinct profiles of lawyers offering their services.

We decided on hosting our prototype chatbot on Telegram due to its popularity, usability and sustainability. Our chatbot uses an inline keyboard to avoid any invalid inputs by users. By editing the messages while options are chosen, the conversation history is kept neat and concise. It also creates a user-friendly experience similar to an interactive menu and facilitates speedy access to legal services as increasingly demanded by many clients today. The usage of a Telegram chatbot is also highly scalable in the long run as it can serve a large population in which many people can simultaneously access the bot at any given time.

We also included a review system of the lawyers and an option for users to indicate their budgets given that a lawyer’s reputation and fees are important considerations. Given that lawyers provide their services at a minimum fee (per hour or fixed pricing), we seek to match clients to a lawyer based on that minimum fee, with a caveat that prices may increase depending on how the case proceeds.

We conducted a system test with 8 users, 7 of whom indicated that the prompts given by the chatbot helped them in searching for their desired legal service. In particular, they appreciated the user-friendliness of the bot and how the inline keyboard streamlined the process.

We hope that through our solution, prospective clients can be matched with the most suitable legal experts available for them, while considering key aspects such as affordability and convenience as well.
